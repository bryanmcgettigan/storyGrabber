# storyGrabber
This project will grab stories and using the kittenTTS will create a spoken version of the stories

The stories grabbed will be a randomly selected two sentence horror story from https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/

The speech will be generated by kittenTTS(https://github.com/KittenML/KittenTTS), a tiny(25mb) text to speech model designed for lightweight deployment and high-quality voice synthesis. It also runs without the need for a GPU
